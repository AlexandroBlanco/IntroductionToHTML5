            <h3>First all-black women's Olympic gymnastics podium</h3>
            <p>At the 2024 Paris Olympics, a moment has highlighted the spirit of sportsmanship and camaraderie on the Olympic stage
                when Rebeca Andrade shared the podium with her two friends: Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles.

            <ol>
                <li>Rebeca Andrade - Gold</li>
                <li>Simone Biles - Silver</li>
                <li>Jordan Chiles - Bronze</li>
            </ol>

            <p>“As soon as we were standing there, me and Jordan looked at each other,” Biles told Olympics.com in an exclusive interview. 
                “We were kind of all cherishing that together because we knew how special it would be, and we knew the impact that it would 
                make on all the little girls around the world that are trying to do what we’re doing, just for them to know that it’s possible.

                Biles and Chiles bowed to Andrade as she stepped onto the podium, a gesture Biles says her younger self might have expected.

                “She would probably laugh and be like, ‘You’re so ridiculous,’” she said. “But that is the most Simone and Jordan thing you 
                guys could ever have done, so she would be very happy that the sportsmanship was there.”
